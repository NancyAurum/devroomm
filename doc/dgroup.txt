Borland's DGROUP refers to a specific segment in the memory model of programs compiled with Borland's Turbo Pascal and Borland C++ compilers. It is part of the segmented memory architecture used in 16-bit DOS applications. Here's a detailed breakdown:
1. Memory Segmentation in DOS

DOS uses a segmented memory model, which means that the memory is divided into segments. Each segment is a block of memory that can be up to 64KB in size. There are different types of segments for different purposes, such as code segments, data segments, stack segments, and extra segments.
2. DGROUP Segment

In this context, DGROUP stands for "Data Group." It is a group of segments that includes the data segment and other segments necessary for the program's data storage. Specifically, DGROUP typically includes:

    The Data Segment (DS): Where global and static variables are stored.
    The Stack Segment (SS): Where the program's stack is located.
    The Extra Segment (ES): Used for various purposes, such as string operations.

3. Purpose of DGROUP

The DGROUP segment is used to simplify access to data. By grouping different data segments together, it allows the program to access various types of data with a single segment register. This is particularly important in 16-bit programming, where the use of segment registers can be cumbersome and limited.

4. Practical Implications

In practical terms, DGROUP helps manage memory more efficiently by ensuring that all data-related segments are within a 64KB boundary, which simplifies pointer arithmetic and segment management. However, this also imposes a limitation: the total size of all data in DGROUP cannot exceed 64KB, which can be a constraint for larger programs.

Example in Borland Turbo Pascal

When you compile a program with Borland Turbo Pascal, the compiler automatically groups the necessary data segments into DGROUP. This means your global variables, static variables, and other data elements are all accessible within a single segment.
Conclusion

DGROUP is an important concept in 16-bit DOS programming with Borland compilers, providing a way to manage and access data efficiently within the constraints of the segmented memory model. By grouping data-related segments, it simplifies memory management and access but also introduces a size limitation that programmers need to be aware of.
